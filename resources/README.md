## Database files
By default, the application will create a database file named `database.db` in this resources folder directory. The database file will be created with the schema defined in the `template_database.db` file. The `database.db` file will be used to store the data of the application.

However, if we wish to start the application with some existing data, then:
1. Create a copy of `template_database.db` and rename it to `database.db`.
2. Make sure that the `database.db` file is in this resources folder directory.
3. Run the application.
